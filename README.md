# Web-development-using-Flask-and-WTForms
    This project also includes Jinja notation.

    Flask has an amazing tool called JINJA.
    JINJA2 is the template engine that comes bundled with the Flask Framework.
    It allows us to input in variables and data into our template.
    
This project majorly shows back-end processing of data rather than focusing on front-end.
